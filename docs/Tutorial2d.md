Welcome to the Hammer documentation. This tutorial will walk you through the evolution of a Hammer project, starting with basic 2D rendering, moving meshs and collision using HammerRect.
This tutorial asumes that you have a midium undersanding of C++.

Now lets get started.

## 1. Creating a Hammer Engine instance.

The foundation of any Hammer project involves configuring the engine settings, initializing Vulkan, and setting up a basic camera.

First we need to a instance of Hammer:

`HammerEngine engine;`

Now we have a instance of the engine called "engine".

## 2. Configuring the Engine.
### 2.1 Validation layers
Validation layers are there to give you more detaled errors than the one Vulkan gives you. For developpement we will turn them on.

`Engine.enableValidationLayers = true;`

You can always turn them off by just changine the true for a false.

### 2.2 Window
In Hammer Engine you can change a few things of the window. These things include: window size (w and h) but also the title of the screen.

```
Engine.WindowWidth = 1000;
Engine.WindowHeight = 1000;
Engine.windowName = "Hammer Engine";
```

### 2.3 Camera position
You can set the starting position of the camera.

`Engine.cameraPosition = glm::vec3(0, 0, 2);`

### 2.4 The texture atlas path
You can give Hammer Engine the path to a texture, but only 1 in the future Hammer Engine will have a way to have many textures but for now only 1.

`Engine.texturePath = "textures/texture.png";`

### 2.5 The mouse
If you are building a app that you need to have the controle over the mouse cursor you can call change the cursor state.
If mouse lock it set to 0 the mouse will be free to move, if it 1 the mouse can not longer move.

`Engine.mouseLock = 0;`






### 3. Initialization

Before we can load textures or create shapes, we have to wake the engine up. This involves two critical calls:
C++

```
Engine.initWindow(); // Creates the GLFW window
Engine.initVulkan(); // Initializes the Vulkan API and graphics device
```

    Note: Always call these after you have set your WindowWidth and WindowHeight, otherwise the engine won't know what size to make the window!

4. Textures and Pipelines

Hammer uses Pipelines to tell the GPU how to process your data and Textures to give your objects color.

4.1 Loading a Texture

We use std::make_unique to manage the memory of our texture. We also specify a filter (like Nearest for crisp pixel art).
C++

`auto mainTexture = std::make_unique<HammerTexture>(Engine, "textures/texture.png", HammerTextureFilter::Nearest);`

4.2 Creating a Pipeline

The pipeline needs your vertex and fragment shaders.
C++

auto mainPipeline = std::make_unique<HammerPipeline>(Engine, "shaders/vert.spv", "shaders/frag.spv", 1, true);

5. Creating a Mesh

A Mesh is the actual object in your world. It requires three things: Vertices (points in space), Indices (the order to connect those points), and the Texture/Pipeline we created above.
C++

// Define a simple square
std::vector<Vertex> vertices = {
    {{-0.5f, -0.5f, 0.0f}, {1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f}, {0.0f, 1.0f}},
    {{ 0.5f, -0.5f, 0.0f}, {1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f}, {1.0f, 1.0f}},
    {{ 0.5f,  0.5f, 0.0f}, {1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f}, {1.0f, 0.0f}},
    {{-0.5f,  0.5f, 0.0f}, {1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f}, {0.0f, 0.0f}}
};
std::vector<uint32_t> indices = { 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0 };

// Add the mesh to the engine's list
Engine.meshs.push_back(std::make_unique<HammerMesh>(Engine, mainPipeline.get(), mainTexture.get(), vertices, indices));

6. The Main Loop

Finally, we create the "heartbeat" of your application. This loop runs every frame until you close the window.
C++

Engine.drawPassStart(); // Prepare the GPU for drawing

while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(Engine.window)) {
    Engine.updateFrameTimeStart(); // Start the frame timer

    // --- Input & Logic ---
    if (glfwGetKey(Engine.window, GLFW_KEY_W) == GLFW_PRESS) {
        // Handle movement or logic here!
    }

    Engine.updateCameraDefault2D(); // Update the camera view
    Engine.drawFrame();             // Render everything in Engine.meshs
    
    Engine.updateFrameTimeEnd();   // End the frame timer
}

Engine.drawPassEnd(); // Clean up GPU tasks

7. Memory Cleanup

Because we are working with C++ and Vulkan, we need to be responsible. Before the program ends, ensure you reset your unique pointers to destroy the Vulkan resources in the correct order.
C++

mainTexture.reset(); 
mainPipeline.reset();

Congratulations!

You've just built a functional 2D rendering loop in HammerEngine. Your engine is now initialized, your textures are loaded, and your mesh is ready for action.
