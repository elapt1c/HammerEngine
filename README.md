# The goal of Hammer Engine
The goal of the Hammer Engine is combining ease of use and the speed of Vulkan to make 2d/3d games as fast and fun as possible.

# The performance of Hammer

The #1 goal of HammerEngine is it's performance on low-end machines. It out-performs many other engines while remaining compatable with as many machines as possible.

# What does Hammer support?

Vulkan Native: Built from the ground up for modern hardware efficiency.

Collision System: Includes a functional, simple collision detection system.

Developer Friendly: Designed for rapid prototyping without sacrificing performance.

Easy to load 3d models: Uses tinyobjloader to load .obj files discards any vertex that is duplicated.

# Docs

The official tutorial is at docs/

# Run demos

## Linux

1. Run the build.sh
`./build.sh`

2. The build will ask which demo you want to run you can put the path to any demo in the demo folder.

3. Run the demo and enjoy.

## Windows & macOS

We are currently looking for contributors to help establish build instructions for Windows and macOS. If you have successfully compiled Hammer on these platforms, please consider submitting a Pull Request or opening an issue with your steps! For windows please check this [branch](https://github.com/MidnightHammer-code/HammerEngine/tree/windows-support) for the latest detals for windows.

# Want to contribute?
We are looking for contributors! If you want to contribute to Hammer go to the issues tab pick an issue and create a fix for it. If you have an idea for a new feature you can create an issue with the label New feature or implement it and create a pull request. We are especially looking for help with:

1. Optimizing the Engine even more for low-end machines.
2. Extended physics/collision features.
3. Separating the functions from HammerEngine.cpp into separate files.
4. Add documentation, to help people learn Hammer Engine.

# How to use?

The Hammer Engine tutorial is being made right now and should be finished very soon. you can find it at https://github.com/MidnightHammer-code/HammerEngine/tree/main/docs.
